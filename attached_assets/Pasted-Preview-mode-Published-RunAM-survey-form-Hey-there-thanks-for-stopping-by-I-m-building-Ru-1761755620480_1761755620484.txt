RunAM survey form
Hey there, thanks for stopping by.

I’m building RunAm, a platform that connects parcel owners to travelers or riders already heading to the same destination.

The goal is to make delivery faster, cheaper, and more reliable for everyday people.


This short survey (about 3–5 minutes) will help me understand if this idea truly solves a real problem in Nigeria, starting with Akwa Ibom.

Your feedback will go a long way. Thank you for being part of it.
